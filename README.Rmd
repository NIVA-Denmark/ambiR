This is an R package implementing **AZTI’s Marine Biotic Index**.

## Overview

The package allows the user to calculate both the *AMBI* index and the
multivariate *M-AMBI* from count or abundance data for benthic fauna species.

In addition, this package includes functions to calculate different
versions of the *Danish Quality Index* (*DKI*) (in Danish: *Dansk
Kvalitetsindeks*), a derived benthic index based on AMBI.

-   `AMBI()` - calculates the *AMBI* index.
-   `MAMBI()` - calculates the multivariate *M-AMBI* index.
-   `Hdash()` - calculates *H'*, the Shannon diversity index.
-   `DKI2()` - calculates the salinity-normalised Danish quality index
    *DKI (v2)*.
-   `DKI()` - calculates the Danish quality index *DKI*.

To get started, see `vignette("ambiR")`. For details about running in 
interactive mode, see `vignette("interactive")`.

The AMBI index was developed by Ángel Borja and colleagues at AZTI. For 
background and explanation of the method for calculation of the AMBI index 
see `vignette("about-AMBI")`. You can also find a link to download the 
original AMBI software.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ambiR from
[GitHub](https://github.com/niva-denmark/ambiR/) with:

```{r install, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("NIVA-Denmark/ambiR")

```

## Examples

This is a basic example using a very small dataset, with 2 stations. In each station there are 3 species counts.
The data is organised in a dataframe with 3 columns in a so-called "long" format. That is, each count is recorded in a separate row.

By default, the `AMBI` function returns both the AMBI results _and_ a list of which AMBI groups species names in input data were assigned to. Here, we also use the argument `format_pct` to show the estimated fractions as percentages. See the function documentation for more details: `AMBI()`.

```{r example}
library(ambiR)

df <- data.frame(station = c("1","1","1","2","2","2"),
                 species = c("Acidostoma neglectum",
                             "Acrocirrus validus",
                             "Capitella nonatoi",
                             "Acteocina bullata",
                             "Austrohelice crassa",
                             "Capitella nonatoi"),
                 count = c(8, 14, 23, 13, 17, 11))

AMBI(df, by = c("station"), format_pct=1)

```

Another example using the supplied `test_data`.

```{r example2}
library(ambiR)

## calling AMBI using the test data set
AMBI(test_data, by=c("station"), var_rep = "replicate", format_pct=1)


```
