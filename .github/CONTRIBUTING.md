### Code of Conduct

By _participating_, that is by contributing to, or commenting on the ambiR

### Corrections to species list

This concerns errors in the species lists. Examples could include 
misspelling of a species name or allocation of a species to an incorrect 
AMBI group.

_If you find such an issue, what should you do?_

The preferred place to register such an issue is in the ambiR GitHub repository. 
You should first check if the issue has already been raised by someone else.

[https://github.com/NIVA-Denmark/ambiR/issues?q=label:"Species%20data"](https://github.com/NIVA-Denmark/ambiR/issues?q=label%3A%22Species%20data%22)

You do not need to be a registered GitHub user to view existing issues. If you 
want so submit a new issue, you will need to register as a user.

Please remember to apply the **Species data** label when submitting the issue.

If you do not want to register with GitHub, please contact 
**aborja _at_ azti.es** or **cjm _at_ niva.dk**. But, do _please_ check first if the
problem has already been noted. 

Corrections will be gathered and used to update future versions of 
the species list. Remember that, while you are waiting for updated versions, you
are free to use your own user-defined species lists, including any corrections 
you deem necessary.

If you are a GitHub user, you can also use the _issue_ functionality to record
issues.
