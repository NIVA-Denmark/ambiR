# ambiR: Calculate AZTI’s Marine Biotic Index

Calculate AZTI’s Marine Biotic Index - AMBI. The included list of
benthic fauna species according to their sensitivity to pollution.
Matching species in sample data to the list allows the calculation of
fractions of individuals in the different sensitivity categories and
thereafter the AMBI index. The Shannon Diversity Index H' and the Danish
benthic fauna quality index DKI can also be calculated, as well as the
multivariate M-AMBI index. Borja, A., J. Franco, V. Pérez, 2000. A
marine biotic index to establish the ecological quality of soft bottom
benthos within European estuarine and coastal environments Marine
