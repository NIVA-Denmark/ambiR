\usage{
AMBI(
  df,
  by = NULL,
  var_rep = NA_character_,
  var_species = "species",
  var_count = "count",
  df_species = NULL,
  var_group_AMBI = "group",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{a dataframe of species observations}

\item{by}{a vector of column names found in \code{df} by which calculations
should be grouped \emph{e.g. c("station","date")}}

\item{var_rep}{\emph{optional} column name in \code{df} which contains the name of
the column identifying replicates. If replicates are used,
the AMBI index will be calculated for each replicate before
an average is calculated for each combination of \code{by}
variables. If the Shannon diversity index \code{H} is calculated
this will be done for species counts collected within \code{by}
groups without any consideration of replicates.}

\item{var_species}{name of the column in \code{df} containing species names}

\item{var_count}{name of the column in \code{df} containing count/density/abundance}

\item{df_species}{\emph{optional} dataframe of user-specified species groups. By default,
the function matches species in \code{df} with the official species
list from AZTI. If a dataframe with a user-defined list of
species is provided here, then this will be used instead.}

\item{var_group_AMBI}{\emph{optional} name of the column in \code{df_species}
containing the groups for the AMBI index calculations. These
should be specified as integer values from 1 to 7. Any other
values will be ignored. If \code{df_species} is not specified
then \code{var_group_AMBI} will be ignored.}

\item{quiet}{warnings about low numbers of species and/or individuals
are contained in the \code{warnings} dataframwe. By default
(\code{quiet = FALSE}) these warnings are also shown in the console.
If the function is called with the parameter \code{quiet = TRUE}
then warnings will not be displayed in the console.

\value{
a list of three dataframes:
\itemize{
\item \code{AMBI} : results of the AMBI index calculations. For each unique
combination of \code{by} variables, the following values are calculated:
\itemize{
\item \code{AMBI} : the AMBI index value
\item \code{N} : the number of individuals
\item \code{S} : the number of species
\item \code{H} : the Shannon diversity index
\item \code{fNA} : the fraction of individuals \emph{not assigned}, that is, matched to
a species in the AZTI species with \emph{Group 0}. Note that this is
different from the number of rows where no match was found. These
are excluded from the totals.
}
\item \code{match} : the original dataframe with columns added from the species list.
For a user-specified list provided \code{df_species}, all columns will be included.
For the default AZTI species list the following additional columns will be
included:
\itemize{
\item \code{group} : showing the species group
\item \code{RA} : indicating that the species is
\emph{reallocatable} according to the AZTI list. That is, it could be re-assigned to
a different species group.
}
}

any species/taxa in \code{df} which do not have a match in \code{df_species} will have
have \emph{NA} in these columns.
\itemize{
\item \code{warnings} : a dataframe showing warnings for any combination of \code{by}
variables a warning where
\itemize{
\item The percentage of individuals not assigned to a group is higher than 20\%
\item The (not null) number of species is less than 3
\item The (not null) number of individuals is less than 6
}
}
}
\description{
Matches a list of species counts with the AMBI species list
and calculates the AMBI index.
}
\details{
Species can be matched to one of five groups, the distribution of individuals between the groups
reflecting different levels of stress on the ecosystem.
\itemize{
\item \emph{Group I}. Species very sensitive to organic enrichment
and present under unpolluted conditions (initial state). They include the
specialist carnivores and some deposit- feeding \emph{tubicolous polychaetes}.
\item \emph{Group II}. Species indifferent to enrichment, always present in low densities with
non-significant variations with time (from initial state, to slight unbalance).
These include suspension feeders, less selective carnivores and scavengers.
\item \emph{Group III}. Species tolerant to excess organic matter enrichment. These species
may occur under normal conditions, but their populations are stimulated by
organic enrichment (slight unbalance situations). They are surface
deposit-feeding species, as \emph{tubicolous spionids}.
\item \emph{Group IV}. Second-order opportunistic species (slight to pronounced unbalanced
situations). Mainly small sized \emph{polychaetes}: subsurface deposit-feeders,
such as \emph{cirratulids}.
\item \emph{Group V}. First-order opportunistic species (pronounced unbalanced
situations). These are deposit- feeders, which proliferate in reduced
sediments.
}

The distribution of these ecological groups, according to their sensitivity to
pollution stress, provides a BI with eight levels, from 0 to 7

\emph{Biotic Coefficient = (0.0 * GI + l.5 * GII + 3.0 * GIII + 4.5 * GIV + 6.0 * GV)}

where:

\emph{Gn := fraction of individuals in Group n [I, II, III, IV, V]}

Under certain circumstances, the AMBI index should not be used:
\itemize{
\item The percentage of individuals not assigned to a group is higher than 20\%
\item The (not null) number of species is less than 3
\item The (not null) number of individuals is less than 6
}

In these cases the function will still perform the calculations but will
also return a warning:
