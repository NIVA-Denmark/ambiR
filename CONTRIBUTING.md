# Contributing to ambiR

This is how you can contribute to ambiR. The authors are happy to
receive all forms of feedback so that we can maintain and improve the
package.

### Code of Conduct

By *participating*, that is by contributing to, or commenting on the
ambiR *project*, you agree to abide by the [code of
conduct](https://niva-denmark.github.io/ambiR/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Raising issues

An *issue* can be used to propose a change to the package. There can be
many reasons for creating a new issue:

- fix a [bug](#bugs)  
- modify or add documentation  
- suggest new features or functions  
- make corrections or additions to the [AMBI species
  list](#corrections-to-species-list)

*If you want to raise an issue, what should you do?*

Some general principles apply, regardless of which type of issue you
have. The preferred place to register an issue is in the [ambiR GitHub
repository](https://github.com/NIVA-Denmark/ambiR/issues)

You don’t have to be an expert to do any of these things. If you have
never used GitHub before, please try it out. However, we would rather
receive your input and feedback by email rather than not at all. So do
not feel that any of these *rules* are absolute.

Before you create a new issue, you should first search [existing
issues](https://github.com/NIVA-Denmark/ambiR/issues) to make sure that
the same issue has not already been recorded by someone else. This check
should be made irrespective of how you intend to report the issue.

You do not need to be a registered GitHub user to view issues. However,
to create a new issue directly, you will need to register as a user.

If have an issue but you do not want to register with GitHub, please
contact **aborja *at* azti.es** or **cjm *at* niva.dk**. Even if you are
not using GitHub to record the issue, *please* check first if the same
or a similar issue already exists.

If you find that the issue has already been created, it is still
possible to contribute with new information or comments.

When creating a new issue in GitHub, please apply a suitable tag to
categorise the new issue.

### Corrections to species list

Issues relating to the species list should be identified by adding the
*‘Species data’* tag.

Examples of modifications or corrections to the species list could
include:

- fixing an incorrectly spelled species name  
- changing the group to which a species is allocated  
- adding a species not yet on the list

Before suggestion modifications, please check that your issue does not
already exist by searching specifically for issues with the *‘Species
data’* tag:

[https://github.com/NIVA-Denmark/ambiR/issues?q=label:“Species
data”](https://github.com/NIVA-Denmark/ambiR/issues?q=label%3A%22Species%20data%22)

Create the new issue directly, remembering to apply the *‘Species data’*
tag. Alternatively, contact the package authors **aborja *at* azti.es**
or **cjm *at* niva.dk**.

Corrections will be gathered and used to update future versions of the
species list. Remember that, while you are waiting for updated versions,
you are free to use your own user-defined species lists, including any
corrections you deem necessary.
