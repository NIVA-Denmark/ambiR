# Contributing to ambiR

This is how you can contribute to ambiR. The authors are happy to
receive all forms of feedback so that we can maintain and improve the
package.

### Code of Conduct

By *participating*, that is by contributing to, or commenting on the
ambiR *project*, you agree to abide by the [code of
conduct](https://niva-denmark.github.io/ambiR/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Raising issues

An *issue* can be used to propose a change to the package. There can be
many reasons for opening a new issue:

- fix a [bug](#bugs)  
- modify or add [documentation](#documentation)  
- suggest [new features](#feature-requests) or functions  
- make corrections or additions to the [AMBI species
  list](#corrections-to-species-list)

After creating an issue, we can collaborate on resolving problems or
making changes and track progress made.

*If you want to raise an issue, what should you do?*

Some general principles apply, regardless of which type of issue you
have. The preferred place to register an issue is in the [ambiR GitHub
repository](https://github.com/NIVA-Denmark/ambiR/issues)

You don’t have to be an expert to do any of these things. If you have
never used GitHub before, please try it out. However, we would rather
receive your input and feedback by email rather than not at all. So do
not feel that any of these *rules* are absolute.

Before you create a new issue, you should first search [existing
issues](https://github.com/NIVA-Denmark/ambiR/issues) to make sure that
the same issue has not already been recorded by someone else. This check
should be made irrespective of how you intend to report the issue.

You do not need to be a registered GitHub user to view issues. However,
to create a new issue directly, you will need to register as a user.

If have an issue but you do not want to register with GitHub, please
contact **aborja *at* azti.es** or **cjm *at* niva.dk**. Even if you are
not using GitHub to record the issue, *please* check first if the same
or a similar issue already exists.

If you find that the issue has already been created, it is still
possible to contribute with new information or comments.

When creating a new issue in GitHub, please apply a suitable *label* to
categorise the new issue.

Read more about issues in the GiHub Docs:
<https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/learning-about-issues/about-issues>

### Corrections to species list

Issues relating to the species list should be identified by adding the
*‘Species data’* label.

Examples of modifications or corrections to the species list could
include:

- fixing an incorrectly spelled species name  
- changing the group to which a species is allocated  
- adding a species not yet on the list

Before suggestion modifications, please check that your issue does not
already exist by searching specifically for issues with the *‘Species
data’* label:

[https://github.com/NIVA-Denmark/ambiR/issues?q=label:“Species
data”](https://github.com/NIVA-Denmark/ambiR/issues?q=label%3A%22Species%20data%22)

Create the new issue directly, remembering to apply the *‘Species data’*
label. Alternatively, contact the package authors at **aborja *at*
azti.es** or **cjm *at* niva.dk**.

Corrections will be gathered and used to update future versions of the
species list. Remember that, while you are waiting for updated versions,
you are free to use your own user-defined species lists, including any
corrections you deem necessary.

### Bugs

If you suspect that you have found a bug, your first step should be to
check if someone else has already found the same
[issue](https://github.com/NIVA-Denmark/ambiR/issues).

The next step should be to create a *minimal reproducible example* or
*“reprex”*. That is, you should strip away as much code as possible that
is not related to the part you think is causing problems.

As the [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org) team write:

*“80% of the time creating an excellent reprex reveals the source of
your problem. It’s amazing how often the process of writing up a
self-contained and minimal example allows you to answer your own
question.”* <https://tidyverse.org/help/#reprex>

A *reprex* that allows others to reproduce the error you found can be
included in the description of the bug when opening a new issue.

If you are familiar with *pull requests*, *forks* and development in
general, you are welcome to contribute directly. Otherwise, opening a
new issue so that someone else can fix the problem also helps.

And, as mentioned above, if none of that it possible, then please
contact the authors by email.

### Documentation

The authors have done their best to explain how the functions in ambiR
should be used. We have spent time testing and trying things out on new
users. However, it is not impossible that some of the explanations could
be improved.

If there is something you don’t understand, or if there are parts you
think could be explained more clearly, please let us know. Either by
opening a new issue (please add the *‘documentation’* label) or by
contacting us through other means.

Again, you are welcome to make your own contributions.

We have created the [AMBI
figures](https://niva-denmark.github.io/ambiR/articles/ambi-figures.md)
*vignette* to demonstrate how to produce a figure showing AMBI results.
As explained, this is not a core feature of the AMBI package but is
intended only as a helpful example and to provide inspiration. If you
have similar examples or ideas for vignettes, this is the place to
suggest them.

### Feature requests

Ideas for improving existing functions or for adding new functionality
can be registered by opening an issue with the *‘enhancement’* label. We
can’t promise anything, but we will consider your suggestions.

Here, direct contributions are also welcome.
