Description: Calculate AZTI’s Marine Biotic Index _AMBI_. The included list of
    benthic fauna species according to their sensitivity
    to pollution. Matching species in sample data to the list allows the
    calculation of fractions of individuals in the different sensitivity
    categories and thereafter the AMBI index. The Shannon Diversity Index _H'_
    and the Danish benthic fauna quality index _DKI_ can also be calculated,
    as well as the multivariate _M-AMBI_ index.
